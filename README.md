# theodinprojectExercises
Aggregates all the repos from The Odin Project containing descriptions on all the exercises and some extra tips.

- The folders euler_problems and google-homepage, consist of two existing repos that are being maintained as part of contributions to "The Odin Project" as they were merged in the initiative's official repository.
- They contain the solutions for the first two mini-projects of the course and can be checked in their respective folders.

# Future work:
This readme as well as the repo itself will be used from now on to aggregate all of the exercises and tips based on the online course at: http://www.theodinproject.com/
