# theodinprojectExercises
Aggregates all the repos from The Odin Project containing descriptions on all the exercises and some extra tips.

- The folders euler_problems and google-homepage, consist of two existing repos that are being maintained as part of contributions to "The Odin Project" as they were merged in the initiative's official repository.
- They contain the solutions for the first two mini-projects of the course and can be checked in their respective folders.

# Folder Tips_JS_&_jQuery
- This folder contains several use cases of jQuery, with small examples to serve as a reference for future use. It covers cases where jQuery can be used to manipulate the DOM in an effective way and shows some use cases based on online research and websites similar to http://www.codeacademy.com and others.

## Serving examples directly from your github repo
To serve examples directly from my own github repository I am using [rawgit](https://rawgit.com/) which allows me to serve files directly via a CDN. Pretty useful.

# Future work:
This readme as well as the repo itself will be used from now on to aggregate all of the exercises and tips based on the online course at: http://www.theodinproject.com/
